West African countries, Jollof Rice. </p> <p>It starts with a tomato based blend which has been fried

<p> Here are some spaghetti tips from her website </p>
<p> Tips for Cooking Spaghetti
Spaghetti should be cooked with a very big pot. That is to say, the pot should contain the spaghetti and still have plenty of unused volume.
Spaghetti should also be cooked in plenty of water. The quantity of water should be at least double the quantity of the spaghetti.
To cook spaghetti, first of all, boil water; add a few spoons of vegetable oil to the boiling water and add the spaghetti. Stir the contents very well and cover the pot. With some spaghetti, you need to stir till the water starts to boil again before covering the pot.

The large amount of water, the boiling water and the vegetable oil altogether prevent the spaghetti strands from sticking together while cooking.</p>
